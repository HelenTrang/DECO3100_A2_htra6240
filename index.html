        <p id="section2P">Despite many continental regions categorised as either developing or developed countries, Asia consists of both developing and developed countries. We will examine more into this by focussing on Central Asia (China and Mongolia), East Asia (Japan, Korea and Taiwan) and Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand etc.).</p>

        <p>Child mortality is a rough topic but it has been fortunately decreasing. However, not all Asian regions are decreasing at the similar rates. For instance, East Asia has the highest decline rate of 5.4%, tying in close with developed continents like Australasia. This is followed by Southeast Asia then Central Asia respectively. But why are they so different despite how close they are? </p>
